                I'm a Front End Developer based in Bangladesh. I describe myself
                as a passionate developer who loves coding, open source, and the
                web platform. I like to create projects. That helps me to learn
                and grow as a developer. Also I enjoy making technical things at
                my college lab. In my free time you can find me tourist place
                ,at field , at the road on cycling around Chittagong bangladesh.
                My future thinking is that I will be a full fledged web
                developer, this is my profession, passion and dream. I spend 8
                to 12 hours a day trying to reach my goals. And I am thinking of
                building a career in this field in the future. Thank You ‚ù§Ô∏è
